What this is: 

This is CloudStack.org's puppet manifest - made visible for the world to see so we can be as transparent and open source-y as possible. 


How this works: 

Well, I assume that if you really want to know how puppet works you'll google it. 

For those of you that already know, the puppetmaster polls this repo every 5 minutes to get updates.
